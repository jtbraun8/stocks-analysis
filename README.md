In summary the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? Refactoring condenses/improves the code so that it is easier to read, easy to work, more reliable, faster and reduces complexities. The disadvantages makes the code specific for this scenario and make be hard to add complexities beyond what the code was originally set up for.
Lastly, how do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script? The array allows for all the securities to be in a loop, otherwise you would have to reinstate the entire code for each security. This would be very time consuming and difficult to find each item that would need to be updated. This would present more times that your security could fail, and more mistakes that could be made. Also, with the refactored code, you could simply delete one the tickers or add a ticker if you ever needed to adjust the securities being run for this code.
